# Scanning services with nmap
Use nmap to discover what services are running on these ports, and you can google to find if there are exploits available for the software verison running on the target machine

# Searchsploit

Once you install the databse of exploits, you can use this tool at the command line to pass in the service and version to find exploit info

# Metasploit
This software is a command line tool that has a console available fired up with the command 'mfconsole'. It contains built int exploits that a user can verify that existence of an a target, scripts to enumerate resources, connect shells and many more.

Once in the mfconsole, you can search through metasploits available exploits to deploy them to a target machine. You first need to indentify exploits of a service on google. Once you know about the existnce of an exploit generally, you can see if metaploit has it with 'search explot <exploit name>'. In order to use the exploit, you need to check the options of the exploit. Metasploit will give you a path for said exploit in its db, and you reveal the options with 'show options <path/to/exploit>'. This will reveal a menu of options, and a column titiled required. You must set the required optons. Sort of like using 'cd', the 'use <path/to/exploit>' command will send you into the location of that exploits to you can set the options. 

Before using the exploit you have to 'check' if the server is vulnerable to it. Not all exploits have the ability to check vulnerability.
